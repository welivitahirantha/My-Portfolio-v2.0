              Living with Corona virus become more challangable to the humans
              these days. In order for people stay in safe during pandemic, they
              have to use new ways to buy items and using health services rather
              than visit grocery stores or go to hospital.

              To get better understanding of the competitor landscape, I
              conducted analysis of popular shopping and health services apps on
              the market. And found pros and cons of that apps. Also found user
              must register to some health service apps to get emergency
              services like call an ambulance.

              shopping and medical services apps, which features they thought
              were most important, and the issues they were facing, I surveyed 5
              users with with different educational background, age, profession
              and health. I want to understand how the users answers would vary
              depending on their skill level, So I separated my findings with
              native speaker and english speaker.

              throughout the project to keep focused.

              needs and frustrations of my users and maintain a user centric

            <p>
              Since simplicity and ease of use are one of the biggest aims of
              CovidApp, the number of screens were kept to a minimum and I
              wanted to focus on highlighting the core features. I started with
              pen and paper wireframes and created multiple versions of each
              screen until I found a combination of features and elements that I
              thought matched the users needs and that would be as intuitivee as
              much as possible.

        <div class="span-col-2">
          <p>
            Next, I created mid-fidelity versions of these wireframes in Adobe
            XD, created a clickable prototype, and found some users to test the
            app.

              This phase was the game changer - by conducting usability tests, I
              was able to refine what users were finding useful, and completly
              changeup what they didnt react well to. The users were asked
              complete a few scenario based tasks thst would test the main
              features of the app, and were asked how they felt about app in
              general.
